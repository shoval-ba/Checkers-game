# Checkers-game

Since my course was a "Sort course", after a month in the course, we needed to build a checkers-game as a project to decide who continue the course and who isnâ€™t.

We started with 80 students in the Pre-course and after the sorts there were only we 40 students remain.

They gave us 3 days to complete this project. At the beginning, I build the board with the players, after that I wrote classes to the player, for every player there is a color, possible moves (like if he can eat other player) and turn. After the user press on a player it's shows him the possible moves of the player, if it can eat, or if it can turn or not.

During this project I have learned a lot, since I had limited time to do it, I needed to prioritize what to do first and additionally I did this project alone, only after a month of learning.
