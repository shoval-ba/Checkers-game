# Checkers-game

Beacuse my course was "Sort course", after a month of the course, they give us to do a checkers-game as a project to decide who contine the course and who not.

In the Pre-course we started 80 students and after the sorts we were 40 students.

They give us 3 days to done this project, and I did it.
In the beggining, I build the board with the players, after that I wrote classes to the player, for any player there is color, possible moves(like if he can eat other player) and turn. After press on some player it's shows you the possible moves of the player, if he can eat, or if it is turn or not. 

During this project I learn a lot, beacuse I have limit time to do this project so I needed to prefer what to do first and also I did this project all alone, only after a month of learning.

Have fun :smiley:
